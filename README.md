# PortSwigger labs exploitation using python.
In this series the main goal is to advance their exploitation and their programming skills. This will teach you how using a simple topics in python you can exploit the labs and move 1 step ahead of the manual exploitation.
Before going into this, I recommend you to be already done with the manual exploitation of these labs. You can either wait to finish all the labs and start over again solving the labs using python, or you can simply finish every single vulnerability manually and use these code snipts to help you to start developing your very first exploit snipts. I prefer the second option.
